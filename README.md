# 🔧 DigitalLab – FPGA-Based Digital Logic Projects

Welcome to the **DigitalLab** repository! This project contains a series of digital logic design experiments implemented using **Verilog HDL** and tested on an **FPGA board**. These experiments were part of the **Digital Electronics and Computer Organization Laboratory (ENCS2110)** course at the Faculty of Engineering and Technology.

## 📁 Contents

The repository includes source code and supporting files for the following experiments:

- ✅ Logic Gates and Truth Tables
- ✅ 4x2 Priority Encoder
- ✅ 7-Segment Display Driver
- ✅ D Flip-Flop and Memory System
- ✅ 2x1 Multiplexer (MUX)
- ✅ Comparator
- ✅ Simple Security System using FPGA (2-digit digital lock)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Quartus Prime** – for Verilog design and simulation
- **ModelSim** – for functional verification and waveform analysis
- **Intel/Altera FPGA Board** – for physical implementation and testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run or simulate any module:

1. Open the project in **Quartus Prime**.
2. Compile the Verilog files.
3. Use **ModelSim** for simulation (optional).
4. Assign pins based on your FPGA board's specifications.
5. Upload the design to the FPGA board.

## 🧪 Featured Project: Simple Security System

A fully functional 2-digit lock system with:

- Input via keypad
- Display using 7-segment LEDs
- Verification using comparators
- Output via green/red LEDs (success/failure)
